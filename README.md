# AudioBook-python
AudioBook is python project which uses Pycharm as an IDE.
AudioBook behaves as a virtual assistant which tells us, what is written in whole pdf.
By using this , we dont have to read the books or pdf , we have to just listen it.
we have used the pyPDF2 for reading pdfs and pyttsx3 for converting text to speech conversion.
